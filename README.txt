This program allows the user to play a single-player dice game based loosely on the game Farkle.

- The game consists of 3 turns, and the aim of the game is to score as many points as possible

- Each turn begins with a roll of 6 standard dice

- Matching dice (2 or more of the same number) can be set aside for points, and the remaining dice can then be re-rolled in an attempt to score more points

- Points are "amount of dice * number on dice", e.g. rolling three 5s is worth 15 points

- The player chooses whether to set matching dice aside and whether to re-roll remaining dice

- If the player chooses not to re-roll the dice, the points accumulated in the turn are added to their score and the turn ends

- If no dice can be put aside after a roll, the player loses the points the potential points and the turn ends â€“ hence, the player must decide how far to push their luck with additional rolls

- The game involves quite a lot of luck, but there is also a small amount of strategy in choosing whether to set matching dice aside and whether to re-roll the remaining dice.
